# Codecademy Data Scientist Carrer Path Projects

This repository contains all the challenges projects I've been making in my Data Scientist Career Path courses.

## [Hurricane Analysis Challenge Project](https://github.com/paola-yumi-m/codeCademy_projects/blob/main/hurricane_analysis_project.ipynb)

In this project I organized and manipulated data about Category 5 Hurricanes.
The functions I wrote use conditionals, lists, dictionaries and string manipulation concepts.

## [Coded Correspondence Challenge](https://github.com/paola-yumi-m/codecademy_projects/blob/main/coded_correspondence.ipynb)

In this challenge I used loops and string manipulation to decode and encode messages.

## [Abruptly Goblin Planners Challenge](https://github.com/paola-yumi-m/codecademy_projects/blob/main/abruplty_goblins_planner.ipynb)

In this challenge, I plan what would be the best day to play a game and who would be able to attend the event.
The functions use dictionaries, loops and lists to achieve the goals.

## [U.S. Medican Insurance Costs Portifolio Project](https://github.com/paola-yumi-m/codecademy_projects/blob/main/us_medical_insurance_costs/us_medical_insurance_costs.ipynb)

In this project, the available dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance) of US Medical Insurance Costs was analysed. The project aims to answer the following questions:

  - What is the average of age people that get insurance?
  - Where is the majority from?
  - Do women pay more than men?
  - Does having more children affect the cost?
  - Does smoking affect the cost?
  - Does age affect the cost?
  - Does BMI affect the cost?
 
The focus was to use only the concepts that were learned during the Python Fundamentals Course, so pandas was not used this time. 
The matplotlib library was used to plot some graphs.
