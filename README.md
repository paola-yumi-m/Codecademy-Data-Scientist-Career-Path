# Codecademy Data Scientist Carrer Path Projects

This repository contains all the challenges projects I've been making in my Data Scientist Career Path courses.

## [Hurricane Analysis Challenge Project](https://github.com/paola-yumi-m/codeCademy_projects/blob/main/hurricane_analysis_project.ipynb)

In this project I organized and manipulated data about Category 5 Hurricanes.
The functions I wrote use conditionals, lists, dictionaries and string manipulation concepts.

## [Coded Correspondence Challenge](https://github.com/paola-yumi-m/codecademy_projects/blob/main/coded_correspondence.ipynb)

In this challenge I used loops and string manipulation to decode and encode messages.

## [Abruptly Goblin Planners Challenge](https://github.com/paola-yumi-m/codecademy_projects/blob/main/abruplty_goblins_planner.ipynb)

In this challenge, I plan what would be the best day to play a game and who would be able to attend the event.
The functions use dictionaries, loops and lists to achieve the goals.
