# Codecademy Data Scientist Carrer Path Projects

This repository contains all the challenges projects I've been making in my Data Scientist Career Path courses.

## [Hurricane Analysis Challenge Project](https://github.com/paola-yumi-m/codeCademy_projects/blob/main/hurricane_analysis_project.ipynb)

In this project I organized and manipulated data about Category 5 Hurricanes.
The functions I wrote use conditionals, lists, dictionaries and string manipulation concepts.

## [Coded Correspondence Challenge](https://github.com/paola-yumi-m/codecademy_projects/blob/main/coded_correspondence.ipynb)

In this challenge I used loops and string manipulation to decode and encode messages.

## [Abruptly Goblin Planners Challenge](https://github.com/paola-yumi-m/codecademy_projects/blob/main/abruplty_goblins_planner.ipynb)

In this challenge, I plan what would be the best day to play a game and who would be able to attend the event.
The functions use dictionaries, loops and lists to achieve the goals.

## [U.S. Medican Insurance Costs Portifolio Project](https://github.com/paola-yumi-m/codecademy_projects/blob/main/us_medical_insurance_costs/us_medical_insurance_costs.ipynb)

In this project, the available dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance) of US Medical Insurance Costs was analysed. The project aims to answer the following questions:

  - What is the average age of people that get insurance?
  - Where is the majority from?
  - Do women pay more than men?
  - Does having more children affect the cost?
  - Does smoking affect the cost?
  - Does age affect the cost?
  - Does BMI affect the cost?
 
The focus was to use only the concepts that were learned during the Python Fundamentals Course, so pandas was not used this time. 
The matplotlib library was used to plot some graphs.

## [Jeopardy! Data Manipulation Challenge Project](https://github.com/paola-yumi-m/codecademy_projects/blob/main/jeopardy/jeopardy.ipynb)

In this challenge, I analysed a dataset containing data about Jeopardy! questions and answers. 
The functions created aim to manipulate the data using pandas, in order to find interesting results.

## [Home Value Trends Project](https://github.com/paola-yumi-m/codecademy_projects/blob/main/zip_codes.sqbpro)

In this project, I analyzed the data on median estimated values of single family homes by zip codes from the past two decades, using SQLite.
The csv file was imported from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ew2rS1O_Mu5dUh59rlVw9IhCy_xrwftk/view).

The project aims to answer the following questions:

  - How many distinct zip codes are in this dataset?
  - How many zip codes are from each state?
  - What range of years are represented in the data?
  - Using the most recent month of data available, what is the range of estimated home values across the nation?
  - Using the most recent month of data available, which states have the highest average home values? How about the lowest?
  - Which states have the highest/lowest average home values for the year of 2017? What about for the year of 2007? 1997?
  - What is the percent change 141 in average home values from 2007 to 2017 by state? How about from 1997 to 2017?
  - How would you describe the trend in home values for each state from 1997 to 2017? How about from 2007 to 2017? Which states would you recommend for making real estate investments?
